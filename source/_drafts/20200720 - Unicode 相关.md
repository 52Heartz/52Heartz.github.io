# UTF-8

> The first 128 characters (US-ASCII) need one byte.
>
> The next 1,920 characters need two bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets, and also Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana and N'Ko alphabets, as well as Combining Diacritical Marks.
>
> Three bytes are needed for characters in the rest of the Basic Multilingual Plane, which contains virtually all characters in common use,[19] including most Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters.
>
> Four bytes are needed for characters in the other planes of Unicode, which include less common CJK characters, various historic scripts, mathematical symbols, and emoji (pictographic symbols).
