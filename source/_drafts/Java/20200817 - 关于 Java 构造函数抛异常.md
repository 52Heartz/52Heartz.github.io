> Throwing exceptions in a constructor is not bad practice. In fact, it is the *only* reasonable way for a constructor to indicate that there is a problem; e.g. that the parameters are invalid.

> I also think that throwing *checked* exceptions can be OK1, assuming that the checked exception is 1) declared, 2) specific to the problem you are reporting, and 3) it is reasonable to expect the caller to deal with a checked exception for this2.

> You should pick an exception class that matches the exceptional condition that has occurred. If you throw `Exception` it is difficult for the caller to separate this exception from any number of other possible declared and undeclared exceptions. This makes error recovery difficult, and if the caller chooses to propagate the Exception, the problem just spreads.

> Yes, constructors can throw exceptions. Usually this means that the new object is immediately eligible for garbage collection (although it may not be collected for some time, of course). It's possible for the "half-constructed" object to stick around though, if it's made itself visible earlier in the constructor (e.g. by assigning a static field, or adding itself to a collection).
