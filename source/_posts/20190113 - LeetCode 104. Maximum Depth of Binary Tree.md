LeetCode官方题解及解析：[104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

# 题目

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its depth = 3.

# 解答1[Java]：递归算法

```java
/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
import java.lang.Math;
class Solution {
  public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      int left_height = maxDepth(root.left);
      int right_height = maxDepth(root.right);
      return Math.max(left_height, right_height) + 1;
    }
  }
}
```

## 复杂度分析

- Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes.

- Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is **completely unbalanced**, *e.g.* each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur $N$ times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be $O(N)$. But in the best case (the tree is **completely balanced**), the height of the tree would be $log(N)$. Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be $O(log(N))$

  **completely unbalanced** would looks like this

  ```
      3
       \
       20
         \
          7
           \
            9
             \
              15
  ```

  **completely balanced** would looks like this:

  ```
          3
       /     \
      9       20
     / \     /  \
    8   4   15   7
  ```

# 解答2[Java]：非递归，遍历

```java
/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
public class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        int res = 0;
        queue.add(root);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode node = queue.poll();
                if (node.left != null)
                    queue.add(node.left);
                if (node.right != null)
                    queue.add(node.right);
            }
            res++;
        }
 
        return res;
    }
}
