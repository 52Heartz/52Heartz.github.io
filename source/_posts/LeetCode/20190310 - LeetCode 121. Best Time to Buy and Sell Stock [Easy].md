题目难度：Easy



# 题目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`



# 解答1[Java]：

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int prices[]) {
        int minprice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < minprice)
                minprice = prices[i];
            else if (prices[i] - minprice > maxprofit)
                maxprofit = prices[i] - minprice;
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```

## 思路

使用两个变量，一个存储截至目前最小的值，一个存储截至目前最大的利润。然后对股票价格依次遍历，每遍历到一个元素都更新当前最小值和当前最大利润，等到遍历结束时，取最大利润值即可。
