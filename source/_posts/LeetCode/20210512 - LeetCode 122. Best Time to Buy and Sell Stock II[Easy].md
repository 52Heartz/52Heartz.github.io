# 题目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`



# 题解

## 解答1[Java]

```java
public class Problem122Solution1 {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int totalProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            totalProfit += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }

        return totalProfit;
    }
}
```



## 思路

假设股价是连续上涨的，比如 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]，那么我们第一天买，然后第 5 天卖，其实等价于，第 1 天买，第 2 天卖，第 2 天再买， 第 3 天再卖。只要后一天比前一天价格高，我们就做操作。反之，如果后一天比前一天估计低，我们就不操作。

这种思路其实就是**贪心算法**的思路。
